# Explaining the script line by line:

### Script Header and Debugging
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- **Line 1:** Specifies the script interpreter, which is `bash` in this case. It tells the system to use the Bash shell to execute the script.

```bash
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e
```
- **Line 3:** The `set -e` command ensures that the script exits immediately if any command returns a non-zero status (indicating an error). This helps to prevent the script from continuing with potential issues.

```bash
# Enable debugging
set -x
```
- **Line 6:** The `set -x` command enables a debugging mode, which prints each command (with its arguments) before it is executed. This is helpful for understanding the script's flow during execution.

### Basic Commands
```bash
sleep 15
echo "#################### Executing 001-critical-standards.sh ######################"
```
- **Line 9:** Pauses the script for 15 seconds. This might be to ensure other processes have completed before the script continues.
- **Line 10:** Prints a message indicating the start of the script execution.

### SSH Security Configuration Function
```bash
# Function to disable root login and enforce key-based authentication in the SSH configuration file
configure_ssh_security() {
```
- **Line 13:** Starts a function named `configure_ssh_security` that will handle SSH security settings.

```bash
  # Check if the system is Debian-based or Red Hat-based
  if [ -f /etc/debian_version ]; then
    echo "Detected Debian-based system."
  elif [ -f /etc/redhat-release ]; then
    echo "Detected Red Hat-based system."
  else
    echo "Unsupported Linux distribution."
    return 1
  fi
```
- **Lines 15-23:** Determines if the system is Debian-based or Red Hat-based by checking for specific files (`/etc/debian_version` for Debian and `/etc/redhat-release` for Red Hat). If neither file is found, it prints an error and exits the function with a non-zero status.

```bash
  SSH_CONFIG_FILE="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
```
- **Line 25:** Defines a variable that holds the path to the SSH configuration file.

```bash
  # Backup the original SSH configuration file
  cp "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE" "${SSH_CONFIG_FILE}.backup"
  echo "Original SSH configuration file backed up to ${SSH_CONFIG_FILE}.backup."
```
- **Lines 28-30:** Backs up the original SSH configuration file by copying it to a file with the `.backup` extension.

#### Disabling Root Login
```bash
  # Disable root login
  if ! grep -q "^PermitRootLogin" "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"; then
    echo "PermitRootLogin no" >> "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"
  else
    sed -i 's/^#\?PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"
  fi
  echo "Root login disabled successfully."
```
- **Lines 32-38:** Disables root login via SSH. If the `PermitRootLogin` option is not already present in the configuration file, it adds it. If it's present (commented or not), it ensures that it is set to `no`.

#### Enforcing Key-based Authentication
```bash
  # Enforce key-based authentication
  if ! grep -q "^PubkeyAuthentication" "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"; then
    echo "PubkeyAuthentication yes" >> "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"
  else
    sed -i 's/^#\?PubkeyAuthentication.*/PubkeyAuthentication yes/' "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"
  fi
  echo "Public key authentication enabled successfully."
```
- **Lines 40-46:** Ensures that key-based authentication is enabled. It adds or modifies the `PubkeyAuthentication` option to `yes`.

#### Disabling Password Authentication
```bash
  # Disable password authentication
  if ! grep -q "^PasswordAuthentication" "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"; then
    echo "PasswordAuthentication no" >> "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"
  else
    sed -i 's/^#\?PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication no/' "$SSH_CONFIG_FILE"
  fi
  echo "Password authentication disabled successfully."
```
- **Lines 48-54:** Disables password-based authentication by setting the `PasswordAuthentication` option to `no`.

#### Restarting the SSH Service
```bash
  # Determine SSH service name and restart it
  if systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -q sshd.service; then
    SSH_SERVICE="sshd.service"
  elif systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -q ssh.service; then
    SSH_SERVICE="ssh.service"
  else
    echo "Failed to detect SSH service. Please check the SSH configuration."
    return 1
  fi

  if systemctl restart "$SSH_SERVICE"; then
    echo "$SSH_SERVICE restarted successfully."
  else
    echo "Failed to restart $SSH_SERVICE. Please check the SSH configuration."
    return 1
  fi
```
- **Lines 56-72:** Detects the SSH service name (either `sshd.service` or `ssh.service`) and attempts to restart it. If the restart fails, it prints an error and exits the function with a non-zero status.

```bash
  echo "SSH security configuration completed successfully."
  return 0
}
```
- **Lines 74-75:** Indicates the successful completion of the SSH configuration and returns a success status (`0`).

### Firewall Configuration Function
```bash
# Function to configure the firewall
configure_firewall() {
```
- **Line 78:** Starts a function named `configure_firewall` that will handle firewall configuration.

#### Debian-based Systems
```bash
  if [ -f /etc/debian_version ]; then
    # Debian-based systems
    if ! command -v ufw > /dev/null; then
      echo "ufw not detected. Installing ufw..."
      apt-get update -y
      apt-get install -y ufw
      echo "ufw installation completed."
    else
      echo "ufw is already installed."
    fi

    echo "Configuring firewall using ufw..."
    # Enable ufw
    ufw --force enable
    # Allow necessary services by port numbers
    ufw allow 22/tcp
    ufw allow 80/tcp
    ufw allow 443/tcp
    # Deny all other incoming connections by default
    ufw default deny incoming
    # Allow all outgoing connections by default
    ufw default allow outgoing
    # Reload ufw to apply changes
    ufw reload
    # Check ufw status
    ufw status verbose
```
- **Lines 80-105:** Checks if the system is Debian-based and whether `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) is installed. If not, it installs `ufw`. It then configures the firewall to allow ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS), deny all other incoming connections, and allow all outgoing connections. Finally, it reloads `ufw` to apply the changes and displays the current firewall status.

#### Red Hat-based Systems
```bash
  elif [ -f /etc/redhat-release ]; then
    # RedHat-based systems
    if ! command -v firewalld > /dev/null; then
      echo "firewalld not detected. Installing firewalld..."
      yum install -y firewalld
      echo "firewalld installation completed."
    else
      echo "firewalld is already installed."
    fi

    echo "Configuring firewall using firewalld..."
    # Start and enable firewalld
    systemctl start firewalld
    systemctl enable firewalld
    # Allow necessary services by port numbers
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=22/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
    # Reload firewalld to apply changes
    firewall-cmd --reload
    # Check firewalld status
    firewall-cmd --list-all
```
- **Lines 107-126:** Checks if the system is Red Hat-based and whether `firewalld` is installed. If not, it installs `firewalld`. It then starts and enables `firewalld`, configures it to allow the same ports as `ufw`, and reloads the firewall to apply the changes. Finally, it displays the current firewall status.

```bash
  else
    echo "Unsupported Linux distribution."
    return 1
  fi
```
- **Lines 128-131:** If the system is neither Debian-based nor Red Hat-based, it prints an error and exits the function with a non-zero status.

```bash
  echo "Firewall configuration completed successfully."
  return 0
}
```
- **Lines 133-134:** Indicates the successful completion of the firewall configuration and returns a success status (`0`).

### Main Script Execution
```bash
# Call the SSH security configuration function
configure_ssh_security
exit_code=$?
echo $exit_code > /opt/script-error-code
```
- **Lines 137-140:** Calls the `configure_ssh_security` function and stores the exit code. This exit code is then saved to a file (`/opt/script-error-code`).

```bash
# If the SSH security configuration was successful, configure the firewall
if [ $exit_code -eq 0 ];
  configure_firewall
  exit_code=$?
fi
```

- **Lines 142-146:** If the `SSH security configuration` was successful (`exit_code` is `0`), it proceeds to configure the firewall. The exit code of the firewall configuration is then stored.
```bash
# Display the final exit code before exiting
echo "Final exit code: $exit_code"
exit $exit_code
```

- **Lines 148-150:** Displays the final exit code and exits the script with that code. This ensures that the script's overall success or failure is communicated.
```bash
echo "#################### 001-critical-standards.sh execution completed ################" > /var/log/001-critical-standards.log
```

- **Line 152:** Logs the completion of the script execution to a file (`/var/log/001-critical-standards.log`).
